## Introduction

Without supervision signals, **<u>R</u>ationale-aware <u>G</u>raph <u>C</u>ontrastive <u>L</u>earning (RGCL)** uses a rationale generator to reveal salient features about graph instance-discrimination as the rationale, and then creates rationale-aware views for contrastive learning. This rationale-aware pre-training scheme endows the backbone model with the powerful representation ability, further facilitating the fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

## Experiments

* Transfer Learning on MoleculeNet datasets
* Semi-supervised learning on Superpixel MNIST dataset
* Unsupervised representation learning on TU datasets



## Potential Issues

Some issues might occur due to the version mismatch.
* ```KeyError:'num_nodes'``` in unsupervised_TU: https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/36, https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/41
* ```AttributeError: 'Data' object has no attribute 'cat_dim'``` in transferLearning_MoleculeNet_PPI: https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/13
